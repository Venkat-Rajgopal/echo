I am a Full Stack Data Scientist developing IOT based solutions for [Zeppelin](https://www.zeppelin.com/de-en/powersystems/) in Hamburg, Germany. I grew up in Mumbai, India where i had completed my undergrad in Statistics.

I graduated in "Applied Mathematics" where in my master thesis *"Deep learning based classification of liquids using ultrasound sensor system data"* i worked on applying Deep Learning methods to classify liquid patterns. I continued my work with Ultrasound Signals and Brain pattern recognition @ [Sonovum - Leipzig](https://www.sonovum.de/). 

Discovering new places on the bike and hiking has been a nice get away.

Thw whole idea of this blog is to self document \_ for my own personal record keeping and learning.

I try to mix topics around: Machine Learning, Coding, Cloud computing.
