This XKCD artwork is quite well know now.

However, if you set up things right, its not a mess at all rather a charm to work with. 
We will see how easy is it with  setting up environments.

We look at the following methods.

## Table of contents

## Python Virtual Environments with `venv`

Installing a specific python version using `venv`

```shell
sudo apt install python3.8-venv    
```

Create a virtual environment with `venv`.

```shell
python3 -m venv <envname>
```

Activate and deactivate the environment.

```shell
source <venv>/bin/acivate

# to deactivate
deactivate
```

## Conda

Download the version of conda you need as below and install.

```shell
wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-py38_4.10.3-Linux-x86_64.sh

# install the above downloaded file
bash Miniconda3-<version>.sh

# remove the file once finished
rm Miniconda3-<version>.sh
```

Update conda

```shell
conda update conda
```

Creating new environments

```shell
conda create --name <env name>

# activate environment
conda activate <env name>
```

Adding packages to conda

```shell
conda install numpy
```

```shell
# Install env with different python version. 
conda create --name condaenv python=3.8.10
```

Adding packages form environments `yaml`.

A `yaml` file needs to be created first as
described [here](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#create-env-file-manually)

```shell
conda env create -f environments.yml
```

Now update environments based on `yaml` .

```shell
conda env update --file environments.yml
```

For all commands refer [conda cheat sheet](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/cheatsheet.html)

## Poetry

This one is my personal favourite just because of its simplicity and how effective it is.
![Poetry](@/assets/blog_resources/poetry_isin.png)

Install poetry with `curl`.

```shell
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/python-poetry/poetry/master/get-poetry.py | python -
```

If python is not found, replace it with `python3`. This could happen if you are using `oh-my-zsh` shell.

```shell
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/python-poetry/poetry/master/get-poetry.py | python3 -
```

Initialise an environment. This automatically creates a `.toml` file in the directory with all packages.

```shell
poetry init
```

Once initialised, install or update if already installed.

```shell
poetry install

# in case of an update
poetry update
```

Adding packages to your project? Just do

```shell
poetry add <package name>
```

Want to build the package as wheel?

```shell
poetry build
```
and you are good to go.

### Pro Tip

1. *Do not install* from `pip`. Always use the `curl` method as above.
2. Poetry installs envs in your `.cache/` directory. This below command will install in your working directory if that's
   the way you work.

```shell
poetry config virtualenvs.in-project true
```
